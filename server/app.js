//NOTE;-
//Use async when:
// You need to perform asynchronous operations (e.g., database queries, API calls, or other I/O tasks) within the route handler

//Don't use async when:
// Your route handler only performs synchronous operations (e.g., rendering a page, sending a response) and does not rely on asynchronous logic.
